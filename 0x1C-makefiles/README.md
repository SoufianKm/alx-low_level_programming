# C Programming Language Makefiles

## Overview
Makefiles are essential tools in C programming for automating the compilation process. They specify how to build executable programs from source code files, manage dependencies, and streamline development workflows. This README provides an overview of Makefiles in the context of C programming.

## Introduction to Makefiles
Makefiles are text files containing instructions for building software projects. They define rules and dependencies for compiling source code files into executable programs.

## Basic Syntax
Makefiles consist of rules with the following structure:

- `target`: Represents the output file or action to perform.
- `dependencies`: Files required to build the target.
- `commands`: Shell commands to execute for building the target.

## Targets and Dependencies
Targets can include executable programs, object files, or other intermediate files. Dependencies are source code files, header files, or other files required for building the target.

## Variables and Macros
Makefiles support variables and macros for defining reusable values and simplifying maintenance. Variables can store compiler options, file paths, or custom settings.

## Common Commands
- `make`: Invokes the `make` utility to build targets specified in the Makefile.
- `make clean`: Removes generated files and resets the project to its initial state.
- `make install`: Installs the built program or files to the system.
- `make uninstall`: Removes installed files from the system.

## Example Makefile
```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c99

app: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o app main.o utils.o

main.o: main.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c utils.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utils.c

clean:
    rm -f app *.o
