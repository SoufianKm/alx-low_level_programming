## General

In this overview, we'll cover the basics of search algorithms, including their types and best practices.

### What is a search algorithm?

A search algorithm is a step-by-step process used to locate specific data among a collection of data. It involves examining elements of the collection and determining if they match the target value being searched for.

### What is a linear search?

A linear search, also known as a sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in a collection one by one until the target value is found or the entire collection is traversed. It is suitable for unordered or unsorted data.

### What is a binary search?

A binary search is a more efficient search algorithm used for sorted collections. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or determined to be absent. It has a time complexity of O(log(n)).

### What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?

The best search algorithm to use depends on various factors, including the size and nature of the data, the presence or absence of sorting, and the desired time and space complexity. For example, linear search may be suitable for small collections or unsorted data, while binary search is preferred for large sorted collections.

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
